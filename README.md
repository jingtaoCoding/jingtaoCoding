### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I have been coding in Elixir/Phoenix for the past few years, and still enjoy doign it a lot. 
- I also code in these: Ruby on Rails, C++, JavaScript (React/Redux/TypeScript), and other script languages, such as Python, Perl, Matable, R, etc.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love dogs and enjoy biking and crabbing.
