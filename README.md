Hi ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my profile! Allow me to share a little bit more:

ðŸ”­ Since 2020, I've been immersed in the world of `Elixir/Phoenix` and `LiveView`, finding continuous joy in the coding journey.
ðŸ’» My diverse tech stack includes proficiency in `Ruby on Rails`, `C++`, and `JavaScript` (`React`/`Redux`/`TypeScript`). I'm also well-versed in various scripting languages like `Python`, `Perl`, `MATLAB`, `R`, and more.

âš¡ Fun fact: Apart from my coding adventures, I'm an avid dog lover. When not immersed in technology, you can find me enjoying the simple pleasures of biking and crabbing.
