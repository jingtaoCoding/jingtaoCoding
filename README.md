### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently leading a team building ads products, and enjoying coding in Elixir. Besides Elixir/Phoenix, I have also been coding in Ruby on Rails, C++, JavaScript (React/Redux/TypeScript), and other script languages, such as Python, Perl, Matable, R, etc. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love dogs and enjoy biking and crabbing.
